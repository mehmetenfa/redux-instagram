# Instagram Clone with Redux and Firebase
### This project is an Instagram Clone project made with React, Redux and Firebase. It is a project I did to improve myself on React and firebase. In the demo version of the project, you can register with the help of firestore, as in the original Instagram, and log in to the account opened after registration. Afterwards, the project will have the ability to post, as in the original Instagram.
## Tools:
- React
- React Router
- React Icons
- Redux
- React State and Props
- React Hooks
